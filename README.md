# LTTng-HSA

A set of tools designed to generate CTF traces that help understand the activity of GPU-accelerated programs built with the HSA API.

Main features :
* provide static [LTTng](https://lttng.org/) instrumentation of the HSA-based [ROCr runtime](https://rocm.github.io/) with function interception mechanisms;
* process and merge the resulting traces to obtain a single unified trace;
* analyze traces with [Trace Compass](http://tracecompass.org/) analyses.

More documentation to come.
